# Time Series Forecasting Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code for a time series forecasting project. The goal of this project is to forecast future values of a time series using machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on ARIMA models.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing: The raw time series data is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and any necessary transformations.
- Model selection: Various models are considered for forecasting, including ARIMA models with different orders and seasonal components.
- Model evaluation: The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Forecasting: The best-performing model is used to make forecasts for future time steps.

## Data
The time series data used in this project is stored in the `data` directory. It consists of historical values of the time series.
## Results
- The best-performing model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.08 on the test set.
